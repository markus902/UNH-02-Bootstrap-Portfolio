                            Thank you Granda, for getting up at 6 in the morning to wait in line for two hours  at the local grocery discounter to buy my first cutting edge PC which clearly was far from putting it in your pocket and carrying it around. When the store opened they typically had 5 units … Grandpa was number 6. This happened in 2004 and was probably the first of many hurdles I had to overcome to pursue a career in web and  development. Luckily on the second attempt a couple months later I  got my <a href="https://www.pcwelt.de/produkte/Im-Test-Aldi-PC-Medion-Titanium-MD-8383-XL-390310.html" target="_blank" class="text_link">Titanium MD 8383 XL</a> and I started teaching myself how to build first simple website, at the time not realising  how much I enjoyed it and to make it a career.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Instead I did quite a view different things in my life: form working in healthcare to getting a MSc. degree and working in agriculture, ending up in sales and product management for a startup - wich was amazing - to customer support roles. All of these job provided me with wonderful experiences but never brought back the enjoyment of coding and teaching myself new skills on my old dinosaur Windows XP machine. Realizing, how much sooner I could have found the ideal career for me I started to take action and setting my goal for the year 2020:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            “I am making websites” - that’s what I want to tell people about me. My name is Markus and here you can see the first steps towards my goal of become a professional web developer.
                            You should do this! These were my words to my family when I decided to go on my exciting journey to become a developer and to finally start doing for living what I am actually enjoying. The day after, I registered for a coding bootcamp at UNH - and look at me: You’re currently visiting my very first serious project which of course will be a work in progress. Feel free to check out my projects and my development as I move forward.
